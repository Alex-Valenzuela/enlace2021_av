# ENLACE 2021

## Project 19: Spatial, temporal, and phylogenetic analysis of COVID-19 spread

The [ENLACE](http://resilientmaterials.ucsd.edu/ENLACE) US-Mexico summer research program summer research program at UC San Diego aims to encourage the participation of students and researchers in the sciences and engineering, while promoting cross-border friendships. The program is an opportunity to explore a variety of interests through work on varied projects, while challenging the person to always consider science in the context of societal needs.  The announcement of the program can be found [here](http://resilientmaterials.ucsd.edu/sites/resilientmaterials.ucsd.edu/files/ENLACE%20%202021/ENLACE2021_Announcement.pdf).
